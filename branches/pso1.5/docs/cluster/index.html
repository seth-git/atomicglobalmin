This section discusses how to run the program on a cluster of Linux computers using a quantum chemistry package and a Portable Batch System (PBS) scheduler.  Other schedulers besides PBS may be used, but these will not be discussed here.  Understanding this section requires familiarity with Linux and your quantum chemistry package.  See also <a href="intro/configuring.html">Section I, F</a> for instructions on configuring the program for various quantum chemistry packages.
