Usage: pso [OPTION]... INPUT_FILE
This program performs searches for minima as specified in the INPUT_FILE.

  -t                           This writes the list of best structures to a
                               temporary file in a readable format. Specify a
                               resume or optimization file followed by the name
                               of the temporary file.
  -c                           This creates Gaussian .com files from the list of
                               best structures. Specify a resume or optimization
                               file, followed by a directory where .com files
                               will be written, followed by a prefix for the
                               .com files.
  -o                           This creates an optimization file from a resume
                               file.  It is used to optimize structures in the
                               list of best structures to their nearest minima.
                               Specify a resume file, followed by the number of
                               structures to optimize at a time, followed by
                               the optimization file to be created.
  -s                           This specifies that the starting population will
                               be seeded with structures from previous runs.
                               Specify an input file, followed by the number of
                               iterations to perform freezing, followed by one
                               or more resume or optimization files.
