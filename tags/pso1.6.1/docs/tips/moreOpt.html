When performing particle swarm optimization or simulated annealing, you may use single point energy calculations or perform optimization to the nearest local minimum.  If you use single point energy calculations during a run, it is beneficial afterward to optimize the list of best structures to their nearest local minima.  This is done by creating an optimization file from the resume file.  When using the -o option, specify a resume file, followed by the optimization file to be created, followed by the number of structures to transfer, followed by the number of structures to optimize at a time:
    <br/><br/>

    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;./helper -o LJ7_PSO.res LJ7_PSO.opt 64 16 
    <br/><br/>

This copies the best 64 structures from LJ7_PSO.res into the population of LJ7_PSO.opt and creates a new empty list of best structures in the LJ7_PSO.opt file.  Open the optimization file and update the directory where the list of best structures is stored as well as the energy header and footer.  To perform energy calculations on your optimization file, type a command like this:
    <br/><br/>

    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;./pso LJ7_PSO.opt
    <br/><br/>

In this example, the program optimizes the best 16 structures in the population, removes them from the population, and updates the list of best structures. Remember that the list of best structures does not contain duplicates, since each structure must be different than every other structure by the RMS distance specified in the optimization file.  After every 16 structures have been optimized, the LJ7_PSO.opt file is rewritten.  If you decide later you want to optimize more or less structures at a time than 16, this number is stored near the end of the optimization file and may be easily changed.
    <br/><br/>

After creating an optimization file, if you decide you want to optimize more structures, you can add them from the resume file.  An example of how to do this is as follows:
    <br/><br/>

    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;./helper -a LJ7_PSO.opt 30
    <br/><br/>

This indicates you want to add 30 additional structures from the resume file.  You can add structures to the optimization file even after you have started performing calculations on the file.
