Particle Swarm Optimization Parameters:
Start coordinate inertia (w): 0.95
End coordinate inertia (optional): 0.8
Reach end coordinate and angle inertias at iteration (optional): 10000
Coordinate individual minimum attraction (c2): 0.1
Coordinate population minimum attraction (c1): 0.1
Maximum Coordinate Velocity (Vmax, optional): 0.2
Start angle inertia (w): 0.95
End angle inertia (optional): 0.8
Angle individual minimum attraction (c2, deg): 10
Angle population minimum attraction (c1, deg): 1
Maximum Angle Velocity (Vmax, optional): 10
Starting visibility RMS distance (optional): 0.01
Increase the visibility RMS distance by this amount each iteration (optional): 0.004
Initialize structures in pairs where each is a near copy of the other (gives non-zero initial visibility): no
Switch to the repulsion phase when (1) diversity is below (optional): 0.05
And when (2) progress hasn't been made for this number of iterations (optional): 40
Switch to the attraction phase when diversity is above (optional): 0.2
When switching to the attraction phase, replace this number of individual best solutions with population best solutions: 200
Don't update individual best solutions within this RMS distance of the best seen by the population: 0.005
Maximum number of allowed iterations: 800
Enforce minimum distance constraints on a copy of each structure rather than on the original: no
Use local optimization (energy value only): no

Save this many of the best "different" structures: 200
Consider 2 structures "different" if their RMS distance is greater or equal to (angstroms): 1.0
Output file name: outputLJ7_PSO.txt
Resume file name (optional): resumeLJ7_PSO.txt
Write resume file after every set of this number of iterations: 10
Print summary information after each set of this many iterations: 10
Cluster node names file (put LOCAL for local nodes): nodes.txt
Job queue template file (used instead of the node names file, optional): 
Number of jobs submitted to the job queue at a time: 
Every other iteration, use the wave function from the previous iteration: no
