   "Desc": "This program performs searches for minima as specified in the INPUT_FILE.",
   "HOptionI": "This option is used with simulated annealing. Normally when a population of solutions is used, the iteration number for each member of the population stays the same, and all energy calculations for a particular iteration must be completed before going on to the next iteration. This option specifies that each member of the population acts as an independent run, meaning that different iteration numbers are allowed for different members of the population. This increases the search speed, since separate runs do not wait for one another. Using this option causes each member of the population to have it's own resume and output file and list of best structures. Type './helper -h' and compare with the -u option.",
   "HOptionM": "This option specifies that one of the mpi processes acts as master, not performing any energy calculations, but assigning these to other mpi processes. When this option is off, mpi processes will not communicate, but will evenly divide up the energy calculations.",
   "HOptionS": "This specifies that the starting population will be seeded with structures from previous runs. Specify one or more resume/optimiation files, followed by the number of iterations to perform freezing.",
   "HOptionTest": "Using this option during a simulated annealing, particle swarm, or genetic algorithm run causes a file called test.log to be created inside the testfiles directory. This log file contains geometries of one member of the population during the entire course of the run, and is meant to be viewed in Molden. Since Molden can only read 2000 geometries from a log file, this program will produce additional log files if more than 2000 geometries are generated during a run. Make sure when using this option that enough hard drive space is available. This option requires no arguments.",
