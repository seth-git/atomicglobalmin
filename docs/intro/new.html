Below is a description of current software development.  This is provided as information and also with the hope of attracting volunteers.  As an open-source project, this software supports fundamental chemistry research and is provided free of charge.  We therefore encourage those who can to contribute.
    <br/><br/>
1. A 2.0 version of this project has been started with an xml input file.  An example of LJ7_Sim.inp converted to XML can be found <a href="LJ7_Sim.xml">here</a>.  This format will be much more intuitive and easy to work with.  Using xml also makes it easier to send information across the network via MPI messages for development of more advanced algorithms.
    <br/><br/>
The new project is being developed in a subversion branch which you can download by typing the following Linux command:
    <br/><br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;svn co https://atomicglobalmin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/atomicglobalmin/branches/2.0 agml2
    <br/><br/>
This will create a folder called agml2.  To compile the program, install the standard 'scons' compiler tool via the Synaptic Package Manager or by typing 'sudo apt-get install scons'.  Type 'cd agml2' to navigate inside the agml2 directory.  Compile the program by typing 'scons'.  Run the program by typing './agml xml/LJ7_Sim.xml'.  This reads xml/LJ7_Sim.xml and copies part of it to output.xml.  Help is needed making the program read and write more of the xml structure.
    <br/><br/>
The xml folder contains more example xml files.  The xsd/agml.xsd file contains the xml schema in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/schema_intro.asp">xsd format</a>.  The xml is read by a fast, light-weight <a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxmldocs/tutorial0.html">tinyxml</a> parser with some xsd libraries built on top.
    <br/><br/>
2. As discussed in a previous section, the program needs methods that create input files for additional quantum chemistry packages.  The program currently can create input files for GAMESS AND Gaussian.
    <br/><br/>
3. Recently work has been started to make the program work in different languages.  An initial beta version of the program with this language support has been released as version 1.6.  Currently the program only has an English translation.  Please help translate messages into other languages.  The program supports translation with the assistance of Google translate.  Please see the previous section for more information.
    <br/><br/>
If you would like to work with some great technologies and build your resume or CV, helping with this project could be a great opportunity!  To volunteer, please contact us by visiting <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/atomicglobalmin/support">support</a> and clicking 'creating a new item'.  Select 'New Feature' for the category, enter a subject and description, and click 'Add Artifact'.  Thank you for helping us make this software great!
