As of version 1.6, this software supports multiple languages.  Language files are stored in the translation folder and have names formated like this: input_[language code].properties.  The code for the default language is stored at the top of strings.cc and tells the program which language file to use.  The program can read input files in any language, but always writes resume and optimization files in the default language.  The helper executable also has a -tr option for translating input, resume, and optimization files to the default language.
    <br/><br/>

Initially, only an English translation is provided.  You can manually translate messages or use Google translate to assist you.  Manual translation is probably better if you know some English, but want to translate as you use the program.  To perform manual translation, simply copy the input_en.properties file and change the language code in the copy's file name.  Then, change the language code in strings.cc to match and recompile the program by typing 'make'.
    <br/><br/>

To perform translation with Google translate you need to (1) create an input_en.arb file which can be uploaded to Google translate, (2) save a new input_[language code].arb file, and (3) convert this file to an input_[language code].properties file.  For step 1, use the 'cd' command to navigate to the translation folder.  Then type './translate.pl'.  Type 1 and press enter, then press enter again.  The translate.pl program will then create an .arb file from the English properties file.  For step 2, log into <a href="http://translate.google.com/toolkit/list">Google Translate</a> with your existing Google account or a newly created Google account.  Upload the .arb file and follow the instructions for translating the strings.  Then download the translated .arb file and place it in the translation directory, naming it with your new language code.  For step 3, type './translate.pl', type 2 and press enter and press enter again.  This causes the program to convert the new arb file to a properties file.  Change the language code at the top of strings.cc and recompile the program by typing 'make'.

Note that the -i pso option is not yet supported when using non-English languages.
