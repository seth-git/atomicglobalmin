This is free software developed by volunteers.  Therefore, we encourage those of you who can to help with this project.  Current project needs are as follows:
    <br/><br/>

1. As discussed in a previous section, the program needs methods that create input files for additional quantum chemistry packages.  The program currently can create input files for GAMESS AND Gaussian.
    <br/><br/>

2. Recently work has been started to make the program work in different languages.  An initial beta version of the program with this language support has been released as version 1.6.  Currently the program only has an English translation.  Please help translate messages into other languages.  The program supports translation with the assistance of Google translate.  Please see the previous section for more information.
    <br/><br/>

3. Work has also been started to convert the software's input file to xml.  This will simplify the file's format and make the software more versatile.  An example of LJ7_Sim.inp converted to XML can be found <a href="LJ7_Sim.xml">here</a>.  A subversion branch containing new code to read this file has been started, and you can download it by typing the following Linux command:
    <br/><br/>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;svn co https://atomicglobalmin.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/atomicglobalmin/branches/2.0 agml2
    <br/><br/>

This will create a folder called agml2.  Type 'cd agml2', then type 'make' to compile the program. Type 'ls -al' to see the contents of agml2.  The xml folder contains example input files.  Typing './agml xml/LJ7_Sim.xml' causes the program to read part of the xml structure in  xml/LJ7_Sim.xml.  The xml/agml.xsd file contains the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/schema_intro.asp">xml schema</a> which has been completed. Classes that read the xml structure are in the input folder.  There is also a <a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxmldocs/tutorial0.html">tinyxml</a> folder containing a fast, compact xml utility that could be used for this project.
    <br/><br/>

Help is needed expanding the classes in the input folder to read and write more of the xml structure.  Another possibility is to use <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/">CodeSynthesis</a> to automatically generate these classes from the agml.xsd file.  If you would like to help in this effort, please contact us by going to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/atomicglobalmin/support">website</a> and clicking 'creating a new item', select 'New Feature' for the category, enter a subject and description, and click 'Add Artifact'.  Thank you for helping us make this software great!
