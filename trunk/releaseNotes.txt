Version 1.6
	- This version adds support for multiple languages.  Currently, only English is available, but messages can be much more easily translated into other languages either manually or via google docs.  See the language support section of the documentation.
	- This version offers documentation in a different format.  The old pdf user manual has been replaced with web-based documentation, which has an added printer-friendly format.  To load this documentation in a web browser, double click the index.html file inside the docs folder.
