Normally when a population of solutions is used, the iteration number for each member of the population stays the same, and all energy calculations for a particular iteration must be completed before going on to the next iteration. This option specifies that each member of the population acts as an independent run, meaning that different iteration numbers are allowed for different members of the population. This increases the search speed, since separate runs do not wait for one another. Using this option causes each member of the population to have it's own resume and output file and list of best structures. Type './helper -h' and compare with the -u option.
